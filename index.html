# Creating &amp; Designing Objects in Modern JS
**By Will Hastings**

???

* Me: Web Dev, Horizontal

---

# Concerns

* Architectural Flexibility
* Robust APIs &amp; Encapsulation
* Ease of Use
* Performance

???

* Want to avoid rigid relationships between types.
* Want to create encapsulated modules w/ robust APIs.
* Want it all to be easy, terse
* Don't want to sacrifice performance

---

# Architectural Flexibility

* Avoid deep, inflexible inheritance hierarchies
* Keep code modular, decoupled
* Respect Open/Closed

???

---

# Robust APIs and Encapsulation

* Clear public interface
* Hidden implementation

???

* Want our public methods to be clear/descriptive
* Want our implementation details hidden so user isn't concerned w/ them

---

# Ease of Use

* Want a pattern or API that is concise and easy to use.
* i.e. not this:

```javascript
var Dialog = ...;

var Modal = function(title, body) {
  this.title = title;
  this.body = body;
};

Modal.prototype = Object.create(Dialog.prototype);

Modal.prototype.open = function() {
  // ...
};

Modal.prototype.close = function() {
  // ...
};
```

---

# Performance

* We don't want it to suffer.
* But we don't want to sacrifice power for premature optimizations
* Consider alternatives before restricting your object-creation strategy
  (e.g. object pools).

>*...if you're only creating a few objects (and by that, I mean 100 or less),
the performance of creating them is basically irrelevant.  If youâ€™ve been led
to believe you need to use prototype, new, and class style coding in JS to get
maximum object creation performance for just a couple of objects, you need to
set such silliness aside.* -- Kyle Simpson, [Sanity Check: Object Creation
Performance](http://blog.getify.com/sanity-check-object-creation-performance/)

# Ways to Create and Design Objects

* Prototypal Inheritance
  * Constructors vs. `Object.create()`
* Concatenative Inheritance (Mixins)
  * Classical vs. Concatenative
* Encapsulation Patterns

---

# Prototypal

* Usually used in manner following classical inheritance
* But there are other patterns that prototypes enable
  * e.g. **OLOO** (Objects Linked to Other Objects)

???

* Create instances from a type

---

# Constructors

* Require use of `new` or internal check.

---

# `Object.create()`

* Create object with prototype as any other object.
* Initialization can be captured in method on prototype.
* Can wrap `Object.create()` and init call in a factory function.

```javascript
var Dialog = {
  init: function(title, body) {
    this.title = title;
    // ...
  },
  open: function() {
    // ...
  }
};
var createDialog = function(body, title) {
  var dialog = Object.create(Dialog);
  dialog.init(body, title);
  return dialog;
}
```

???

* Factory doesn't need `new`

---

# Concatenative Inheritance

* Extending type or instance with properties from multiple source types or objects.
* a.k.a. Mixins
* Avoids perils of classical, single-inheritance hierarchies
* Takes advantage of JS's *dynamic runtime object extension*
* Gives power of another full language feature like Ruby's modules or Scala's traits

---

# Encapsulation Patterns

## Underscore Convention

???

* How do we hide internals implementation details and keep public API clean?

---

## Closure-Based

???

* Bestows true privacy to state and implementation methods
* Hard to distinguish free variables from
* Inheritance is off the table?

## Closured-Methods Only

???

* Doesn't protect state
* Requires remembering to use `call()`

# Implementations

* Resig Inheritance
* Stampit
* Fiber
* ES6 Classes
* Protomatter.js (plug of debatable shamefulness)
